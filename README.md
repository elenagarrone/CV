Elena Garrone 
=============

After spending the past 3 years working as a restaurant supervisor I decided that I needed a big change in my life. I've always been very interested and passionate about new technologies so I decided to enroll at Makers Academy, on their 12 week intensive web development bootcamp. Even though the course has been very challenging and sometimes frustrating, spending 10-11 hours per day coding, I had a lot of fun. I'm now looking for a developer role which allows me to widen my coding skills possibly in an Agile environment.
